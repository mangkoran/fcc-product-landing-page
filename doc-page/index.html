                            It is a story as old as time. A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic
                            vimmer-envious of the features of modern text editors-spirals into despair
                            before he succumbs into the dark side. This is his config.

                        Doom is a configuration framework for GNU Emacs tailored for Emacs bankcruptcy
                        veterans who want less framework in their framework, a modicum of stability
                        (and reproducibility) from their package manager, and the performance of
                        a hand rolled config (or better). It can be a foundation for your own config
                        or a resource for Emacs enthusiasts to learn more about our favorite operating system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's design is guided by these mantras:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Gotta go fast. Startup and run-time performance are priorities. Doom goes
                            beyond by modifying packages to be snappier and load lazier.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Close to metal. There's less between you and vanilla Emacs by design.
                            That's less to grok and less to work around when you tinker. Internals
                            ought to be written as if reading them were part of Doom's UX, and it is!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Opinionated, but not stubborn. Doom is about reasonable defaults
                            and curated opinions, but use as little or as much as you like.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Your system, your rules. You know better. At least, Doom hopes so! It won't
                            automatically install system dependencies (and will force plugins not to either).
                            Rely on doom doctor to tell you what's missing.

                            Nix/Guix is a great idea! The Emacs ecosystem is temperamental. Things break
                            and they break often. Disaster recovery should be a priority! Doom's package
                            management should be declarative and your private config reproducible,
                            and comes with a means to roll back releases and updates (still WIP).
